# ClubMembership Smart Contract

This smart contract manages memberships within a club, allowing users to join, leave, and check their membership status. It utilizes Solidity version 0.8.0 and follows the MIT license.

## Overview

The `ClubMembership` contract provides a simple yet effective way to manage memberships within a decentralized club. Members can join, leave, and check their membership status through predefined functions. The contract also includes a function to validate the integrity of the membership system, primarily for demonstration purposes.

## Key Features

- **Joining the Club**: Users can become members by calling the `joinClub()` function. This function ensures that a user cannot join if they are already a member.
- **Leaving the Club**: Members can leave the club by invoking the `leaveClub()` function. This function checks if the caller is indeed a member before proceeding.
- **Checking Membership Status**: The `checkMembership(address user)` function allows anyone to query whether a specific address is a member of the club.
- **Membership Integrity Validation**: The `validateMembership()` function demonstrates how to use assertions to ensure the integrity of the membership state.
